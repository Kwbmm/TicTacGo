# TicTacGo
A TicTacToe Go Implementation to practice my Go skills

# Repository Structure
Since this is pet repository to learn go, I decided to structure it so that I can see the improvements made as I keep learning more.

  - Master will always contain the most up-to-date version of TicTacToe
  - The other branches (v0, v1, ...) are _"snapshots"_ of TicTacToe
  - Newest snapshot is merged to `master`
